Description:
	Square1 is first constructed, it is a 10x10 integer array.
	Then the user enters a size for the second square and it is
		created, using numbers 0 - n, where n is between 2 and 10
		inclusive.
	Finally a diamond that has n rows is created using digits less 
		than n.

Files:
	Makefile
	square1.h
	square2.h
	diamond.h
	
	main.c
	square1.c
	square2.c
